This post will serve as an introduction to others that will follow. I will try to remember to update this publication to add a reference to the new ones but I can't promise I won't forget. Meanwhile, feel free to use the tags at the end to scroll through related articles.

Let's begin #100DaysToOffload publication no. 2, shall we?

## What computer-like devices do I use and what do I do with them?

Let's try not to forget anything:

* personal laptop
* work laptop (currently home because of the pandemic, otherwise it usually stays at the office)
* smartphone
* tablet (iPad Air 3 with Apple Pencil)
    * media consumption (Plex, YouTube)
    * note-taking, annotating documents, sketching
    * accessing my recipes (I use [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/))
    * writing, sometimes
* [Raspberry Pi 3 model B+](/raspberry-pi)
    * [Pi-Hole](/pi-hole)
    * Home Assistant*
    * Monitoring of the other things*
* [Synology NAS](/synology-nas-stream-and-backup) (DS216play)*
    * Backups (personal laptop and Raspberry Pi)
    * Plex
* "smart" TV
    * Play Plex content
* "smart" speaker
    * Play smartphone music or smart TV sound
* a set of connected light bulbs, plugs and wall switches*
    * Automate some things like "don't kill your eyes in the bathroom at night but see where you pee during the day"

At this point, you should have a global view of the devices I own and use daily. This will be a valuable reference for later posts when I talk about how these devices and services integrate. I'll especially focus on items marked with an asterisk (&ast;).

This post feels slightly hollow but I consider it's necessary to properly introduce the next ones and give a bit of context. Hopefully, the following articles will be denser.

The next story will probably be about my Synology NAS and what I use it for.
