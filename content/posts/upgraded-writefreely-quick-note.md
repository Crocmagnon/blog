I upgraded [writefreely](https://github.com/writeas/writefreely) (the software that powers this blog) to get a fix making my #100DaysToOffload tags now clickable (they were previously not). So I'll stop adding the HundredDaysToOffload tag which was there as a temporary workaround.

If you use it to track my posts, please move to #100DaysToOffload.

Keywords/tags:
