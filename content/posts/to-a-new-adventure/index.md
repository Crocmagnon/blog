After leaving ITSF in January, I spent February at Gatewatcher. The company is in Paris so the position was fully remote, with 2-3 days per month on site. Unfortunately and despite my hopes, it didn't work for me.

After a month of job hunting, I'm happy to report that I'll be joining [OVHcloud](https://ovhcloud.com) in April! They have offices in Lyon so the remoteness shouldn't be an issue, though the people I'll be teaming up with are distributed in France and Canada. I've been hired as a software developer & site reliability engineer. I'll be mostly developing in Go and Python.

* [Alstom](https://www.alstom.com/) - Very large worldwide group specialized in rail transport.
    * The project they were hiring for: [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/project-software-designer-netbox-1-at-alstom-3495964133)

Anyway, I'm really excited to start my new job! Wish me luck ðŸ˜Š
