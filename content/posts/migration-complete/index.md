I just moved this blog to my self-hosted server at home. Hopefully nothing is broken but if you see something strange or missing, please [contact me](/about-me/)! ðŸ˜ƒ

I also hope we won't experience any major outages like power (both the server and the router are on UPS) or network. ðŸ¤”

I still have a few things to move before decommissioning my VPS but I'd say the hard work is done ðŸ‘Œ
