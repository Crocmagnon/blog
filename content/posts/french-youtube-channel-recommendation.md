Today's very quick post is a recommendation to a french YouTube channel. It's called [Chat Sceptique](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOuIgj0CYCXCvjWywjDbauw) and features a statistician popularizing many different topics related to statistics.

The same person was behind another channel which is not active anymore due to conflicts between the team members: [La statistique expliquée à mon chat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWty1tzwZW_ZNSp5GVGteaA).

If you understand french, I highly recommend taking a look at both channels and subscribing if you like it!
