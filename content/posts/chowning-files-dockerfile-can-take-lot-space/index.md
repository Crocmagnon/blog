Today I learned that recursively changing the owner of a directory tree in a Dockerfile can result in some serious increase in image size.

## ðŸš› The issue
You may remember how in a [previous post]({{< ref "docker-images-layers-and-cache/" >}}) we used a small example to discuss layers and final image size. Well, here's our example again, slightly modified.

```Dockerfile {hl_lines="5"}
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /app
RUN fallocate -l 100M example
RUN chown 33:33 example
```

Given that the base image weighs ~75MB, we could expect the final image to weigh ~175MB (~75 from the base image + ~100 from the big file we generated).

It turns out that since `chown`ing the file modifies it, the `example` file will count twice: once in the `fallocate` layer, and once in the `chown` layer, resulting in an image size of ~275MB.

## ðŸ“‰ Workaround
Since creating "large" amounts of data in a Docker image can be quite common (think about dependencies, static files, etc), I guess that workaround strategies are required. Fortunately, our backs are covered.

Let's take a slightly more complex example to illustrate some real life situations you might encounter:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu AS build
WORKDIR /build
RUN fallocate -l 100M binary

FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /app
RUN fallocate -l 100M example
COPY --from=build /build/binary /app/binary
RUN chown -R 33:33 /app
```

This results in an image weighing 492MB. Let's bring it down to 283MB! (2x~100MB + ~75MB)

```Dockerfile {hl_lines="9 14 15 19"}
FROM ubuntu AS build
WORKDIR /build
RUN fallocate -l 100M binary

FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /app

# /app is empty so only the folder is modified.
RUN chown -R 33:33 /app

# Running these in the same step prevents docker
# from generating an intermediate layer with the
# wrong permissions and taking precious space.
RUN fallocate -l 100M example \
	&& chown 33:33 example

# Using --chown with COPY or ADD copies the files
# with the right permissions in a single step.
COPY --chown=33:33 --from=build /build/binary /app/binary
```

There you go! By being smart about when to run the permission changes, we just saved ourselves 200MB of disk space and network bandwidth. That's about 60% for this specific image!

In the specific case I was investigating at [ITSF](https://itsf.io), the image went from ~1.6GB to ~0.95GB just from this `chown` trick. We were copying a bunch of files in a directory and at the end we chowned the whole directory recursively. That directory weighed about 650MB, which counted twice in the final image size.

Of course this also works with "simple" `COPY` and `ADD` instructions. It's not reserved to copying files from other stages.

## ðŸ““ Don't forget history!
I discovered that the `chown` was taking that much space using the underrated `docker history` command. I already briefly [introduced]({{< ref "docker-images-layers-and-cache/#cache-invalidation" >}}) it previously but now felt like a good time to remind you of its existence ðŸ™‚

Running it with our big 492MB image, here's the output:

```
$ docker history fat-image

IMAGE          CREATED          CREATED BY                                      SIZE      COMMENT

f643c72bc252   3 months ago     /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["/bin/bash"]            0B
<missing>      3 months ago     /bin/sh -c mkdir -p /run/systemd && echo 'doâ€¦   7B
<missing>      3 months ago     /bin/sh -c [ -z "$(apt-get indextargets)" ]     0B
<missing>      3 months ago     /bin/sh -c set -xe   && echo '#!/bin/sh' > /â€¦   811B
<missing>      3 months ago     /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:4f15c4475fbafb3feâ€¦   72.9MB
```

All the `<missing>` rows plus the first row with a real ID above (`f643c72bc252`) are the layers of the base image. All the layers above are the ones that compose our image. We can clearly see that the `chown` layer weighs 210MB by itself.

That wraps it up for today! As always, I hope you learned something along the way ðŸ˜Š
