I just finished reading [Kev's article](https://kevquirk.com/on-subscriptions) on the subject, and wanted to share my thoughts on the subject.

So without further ado, let's get started!

| Service | Monthly cost (€) |
| --- | --- |
| Amazon Prime | 5.82 |
| Incogni | 5.99 |
| Nintendo Online | 3.33 |
| YNAB | 7.66 |
| Domain names | 4.29 |
| Migadu | 3.87 |
| Bitwarden (family) | 3.33 |
| Disney+ | 4.50 |
| Backblaze | 3.54 |
| Apple One (family) | 31.95 |
| Digiposte | 2.99 |
| YouTube Premium (family) | 23.99 |
| Velo'v (bike sharing) | 2.59 |
| NextINpact | 1.33 |
| Mobile | 26.98 |
| **Total** | **105.18** ($112.95) |

Half of these are paid annually. I simply divided by 12 to get the monthly amount.

I'm getting a lot of value out of Amazon Prime as I often tinker with home automation, electronics, 3D printing and stuff and getting next-day delivery is unbeatable.

Disney+ and Apple TV+ (with Apple One) are the only TV streaming services we're subscribed to, I guess that's honest given the current state of things.

YouTube Premium is expensive, but we watch a lot of YT videos at home on the Apple TV and this was the easiest way of not getting hammered with ads.

We could probably downgrade our Apple One subscription to individual services, but I like the occasional Arcade game or Fitness+ session.

Digiposte is a helpful service provided by La Poste (the French Post Office) which automatically downloads documents from online providers such as banks, insurance companies, etc. It stores them in an online "vault" which means I don't have to worry about saving these myself.

I tend to avoid subscription software where it doesn't make sense, like paying a regular fee to access a local software, so I don't fall in subscription hell.

## Voilà!

I was aware of this amount since I use YNAB to manage my budget, so I allocate money to these explicitly every month.
